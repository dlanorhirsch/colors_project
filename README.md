# colors-charts
## Exploratory project for development purposes.

### Languages used:
1. HTML 
2. Javascript
3. CSS


This project started with practicing [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code in the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) and applying it to a project involving color.

ELements were dynamically created using Javascript including text nodes, event handlers/listeners, buttons, etc. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the project. 

CSS was applied for styling, including [Flex-Box] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)  and  [Grid] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
  
  

The development of this project is ongoing, future goals include functionality to create color palettes and more.
